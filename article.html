	<p>The iPhone is a series of smartphones made by Apple since 2007. It does many things that a computer can do, but is small enough to fit in someone's hand. It is a mobile phone, meaning that it makes calls and send text messages without wires. There are many types of iPhone, such as the newest model, the iPhone X.

The iPhone can access the Internet as well, either using a cellular network or over Wi-Fi. Like an iPod, it plays music and videos that have been downloaded from the Internet directly, or which have been put on it by connecting it to a personal computer, which is called syncing. It also has a calendar and camera. A user can also make it do many other things, such as video games, by downloading apps from the App Store.

The iPhone does not have as many buttons as other well-known phones in its early days, such as those made by companies like Motorola and Nokia. Instead, it has a big screen that covers much of the front. People control the phone by touching things that appear the screen with a finger or two. This technology is called multi-touch, and involves tapping, dragging, and even typing on a keyboard shown on the screen.

All iPhones run on a mobile operating system which Apple calls iOS. A new version comes out every year, each having more features than the one before. Each new iPhone comes with the latest version of iOS, and older iPhones usually also get a software update to the latest version. The most recent iPhones, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, use iOS 11 and came out in September 2017.</p>
